### If PHP is NOT Installed:

#### Method 1: Download PHP Directly
1. Go to: https://windows.php.net/download/
2. Download "Thread Safe" ZIP file for your system (x64 or x86)
3. Extract to `C:\php\` 
4. Add `C:\php\` to your Windows PATH:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", find "Path", click "Edit"
   - Click "New", add `C:\php`
   - Click "OK" on all windows
5. Restart Command Prompt

4. Place project folder in `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
5. Access via: http://localhost/event-config-form/

#### Method 3: Use Windows Package Manager
```powershell
# In PowerShell as Administrator
winget install PHP.PHP
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "php is not recognized as internal or external command"
- PHP is not installed or not in PATH
- Follow installation steps above

### "Address already in use" error
- Another service is using port 8000
- Try a different port:
  ```cmd
  php -S localhost:8001
  ```

### Permission errors with saved_configs folder
- Right-click the folder ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Security
- Give "Full Control" to your user account

### Form not saving configurations
- Check that `saved_configs/` folder exists and is writable
- Ensure PHP has file write permissions

## üåê Alternative Local Servers

### Using Python (if PHP not available)
```cmd
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
*Note: This only serves static files, PHP functionality won't work*

### Using Node.js (if available)
```cmd
npx http-server -p 8000
```

## üîí Security Notes

- This is a development server only
- Do not use for production
- Only accessible from your local machine

## üì± Accessing from Mobile/Other Devices

To test on mobile devices on the same network:
1. Find your computer's IP address:
   ```cmd
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter

2. Start server binding to all interfaces:
   ```cmd
   php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

3. Access from mobile: http://[YOUR-IP]:8000
   Example: http://192.168.1.100:8000
