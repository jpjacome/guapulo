# 🚨 Quick Fix for Directory Error

The error shows you're running the script from the wrong directory. Here are **3 easy solutions**:

## ✅ **SOLUTION 1: Use File Explorer (Easiest)**

1. Open **File Explorer** (Windows key + E)
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\jpjac\OneDrive\Documents\jpj1\guapulo\parrillazo\dev\event-config-form`
3. **Double-click `start-server-smart.bat`** from INSIDE that folder
4. ✨ This new smart script will work from anywhere!

## ✅ **SOLUTION 2: Use Command Prompt**

1. Press **Windows key + R**
2. Type: `cmd` and press Enter
3. Copy and paste this command:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Users\jpjac\OneDrive\Documents\jpj1\guapulo\parrillazo\dev\event-config-form" && start-server.bat
   ```
4. Press Enter

## ✅ **SOLUTION 3: Use the Smart Script** 

I've created a new script that finds the project automatically:

1. **Double-click `start-server-smart.bat`** from anywhere
2. It will automatically locate the project directory
3. No navigation required!

## 🔍 **What Happened?**

The original script was looking for `index.php` in the current directory, but you ran it from a different location. The new smart script will:

- ✅ Auto-detect the project location
- ✅ Navigate to the correct directory
- ✅ Start the server automatically
- ✅ Open your browser
- ✅ Show helpful status messages

## 📁 **Expected Files in Project Directory:**

When in the correct directory, you should see:
- `index.php` ← Main form file
- `style.css` ← Styling
- `script.js` ← JavaScript functionality
- `start-server.bat` ← Original script
- `start-server-smart.bat` ← New smart script
- `saved_configs/` ← Configuration storage folder

**Try the smart script now** - it should work from any location and automatically find your project! 🚀
